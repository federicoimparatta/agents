# Core Feature Pod Playbook

This playbook describes how the lean Contains Studio feature pod ships an outcome-focused feature in six-day cycles. The process blends Marty Cagan's empowered team principles with the nimble tooling of Sidetool-sized agencies.

## Roles at a Glance

| Role | Focus | Primary Responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| feature-pod-orchestrator | Glue | Intake triage, ritual cadence, artifact hygiene |
| product-strategist | Value | Frame opportunities, define success metrics, lead discovery synthesis |
| product-designer | Usability | Translate insights into experiences, validate solutions, steward design system |
| tech-lead | Feasibility | Shape architecture, guide implementation, ensure quality and observability |
| delivery-partner | Flow | Sequence work, remove blockers, drive continuous improvement |
| business-partner | Viability | Validate commercial impact, craft GTM narratives, own business measurement |

Each role is an autonomous agent you can invoke individually, but they work best when orchestrated as a compact squad.

## Six-Day Feature Lifecycle

### Day 0 — Intake & Alignment
1. **Trigger**: New opportunity arrives via intake form, leadership request, or metrics alert.
2. **Orchestrator** spins up the pod, prepares a one-page brief (problem, target user, outcome, constraints).
3. **Product-strategist** confirms the customer problem, target segment, and hypothesis.
4. **Business-partner** validates commercial stakes and success metrics.
5. **Delivery-partner** publishes the sprint play (milestones, ownership, decision checkpoints).

### Day 1 — Discovery Sprint
1. **Product-designer** and **product-strategist** run rapid discovery: interview prep, assumption mapping, data pulls.
2. **Tech-lead** investigates feasibility, runs spikes for risky integrations, and flags dependencies.
3. **Business-partner** drafts viability scenarios and launch positioning angles.
4. Orchestrator tracks decisions, ensuring discovery outputs feed the solution shaping session.

### Day 2 — Solution Shaping
1. Pod convenes (async or live) to share insights and align on the smallest lovable solution.
2. **Product-designer** produces prototype flows aligned to the desired outcome.
3. **Tech-lead** slices the solution into vertical increments with testing and instrumentation requirements.
4. **Product-strategist** finalizes success metrics, acceptance criteria, and experiment design.
5. **Delivery-partner** updates the sprint plan, locks commitments, and surfaces remaining risks.

### Days 3–4 — Build & Validate
1. **Tech-lead** and engineering partners implement the selected slice, pairing with design as needed.
2. **Delivery-partner** runs daily syncs, keeps WIP limits healthy, and expedites decisions.
3. **Product-designer** conducts quick usability checks or fake-door tests; feeds insights back to engineering.
4. **Business-partner** prepares GTM collateral, messaging, and measurement dashboards.
5. Orchestrator monitors progress, adjusts ceremonies, and ensures blockers are escalated.

### Day 5 — Launch Prep & Release
1. **Tech-lead** signs off on quality (tests, observability, rollback).
2. **Delivery-partner** completes launch checklist (support scripts, documentation, coordination).
3. **Business-partner** syncs with marketing/sales stakeholders and finalizes enablement.
4. **Product-strategist** communicates expected impact and risk mitigations to leadership.
5. Orchestrator triggers launch, captures final state, and schedules measurement cadence.

### Day 6 — Measurement & Learning
1. **Product-strategist** and **business-partner** review early metrics, qualitative feedback, and finance data.
2. **Tech-lead** audits telemetry for stability, performance, and anomalies.
3. **Product-designer** gathers UX signal (session replays, quick interviews) for iteration planning.
4. **Delivery-partner** runs retro focused on system improvements and updates the experiment log.
5. Orchestrator compiles the outcome report: what shipped, what we learned, what we do next.

## Decision & Communication Cadence

- **Sprint Brief** (Day 0): Shared doc linking to brief, success metrics, backlog, and rituals.
- **Daily Update** (Async): Status, blockers, decisions needed, metrics snapshot.
- **Solution Review** (Day 2): Validate scope, prototypes, and feasibility before heavy build.
- **Launch Review** (Day 5): Confirm readiness across value, usability, feasibility, and viability.
- **Outcome Review** (Day 6): Metrics readout plus next steps.

## Checklists

### Intake Checklist
- [ ] Problem statement and target user captured
- [ ] Desired outcome and guardrail metrics defined
- [ ] Key constraints (tech, legal, budget) noted
- [ ] Success horizon agreed (e.g., 14-day activation lift)
- [ ] Decision-makers and stakeholders identified

### Launch Checklist
- [ ] Acceptance criteria met and demo recorded
- [ ] Tests, telemetry, and rollback plan signed off by tech-lead
- [ ] Support and documentation updated
- [ ] GTM messaging, enablement, and analytics dashboards ready
- [ ] Post-launch measurement owners confirmed

### Measurement Checklist
- [ ] Outcome metrics vs. target reviewed
- [ ] Qualitative feedback synthesized
- [ ] Financial / viability impact assessed
- [ ] Follow-up experiments or backlog items captured
- [ ] Retro actions assigned and tracked

## Artifacts & Templates

- **Intake Brief**: One-page doc linking to research, metrics, and constraints.
- **Opportunity Solution Tree**: Visual map of problems, opportunities, and experiments.
- **Experiment Log**: Table of hypotheses, methods, results, and next steps.
- **Sprint Board**: Kanban board with discovery/delivery swimlanes and WIP limits.
- **Outcome Report**: Post-launch summary with metrics, insights, decisions.

## Tooling Principles

- Prefer collaborative, asynchronous tools (Notion, Linear, FigJam, Loom) that support quick iteration.
- Automate status updates where possible (dashboards, alerts) to reduce manual reporting.
- Keep documentation lightweight but discoverable; link artifacts rather than duplicating content.

## Continuous Improvement

After each sprint, the orchestrator and delivery-partner evaluate the pod's velocity, quality, and outcome attainment. Improvements are captured as experiments in the playbook backlog and prioritized alongside product bets. Celebrate wins, document learnings, and keep the squad small, focused, and hungry.

This playbook evolves with every feature shipped—update it relentlessly.
