# Agency Handbook

This handbook outlines how the Contains Studio AI agency runs client engagements
without relying on sprint rituals. Work flows through flexible phases that keep
the focus on outcomes, insight, and momentum.

## Roles at a Glance

| Role | Focus | Primary Responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| strategy-partner | Direction | Frame opportunities, test viability, narrate decisions |
| design-partner | Experience | Shape interactions, validate solutions, align intent with craft |
| technology-partner | Delivery | Plan architecture, manage technical risk, safeguard quality |
| operations-partner | Flow | Coordinate execution, communicate status, measure outcomes |
| devil-advocate | Challenge | Stress-test assumptions, expose risks, surface edge cases |

Each role operates independently but they work best when the strategy-partner
sets the initial context, the devil-advocate pressure-tests the plan, and the
other partners execute with confidence.

## Engagement Phases

### 1. Intake & Alignment
- Capture the client objective, target audience, and definition of success.
- Surface constraints: budget, time, compliance, technology, or brand
  requirements.
- Decide which agency partners are required immediately and set the first review
  checkpoint.

**Checklist**
- [ ] Problem statement and desired outcome documented
- [ ] Stakeholders, decision makers, and reviewers identified
- [ ] Existing insight or research linked in a single source of truth
- [ ] Success measures and guardrails agreed
- [ ] Responsibilities and communication cadence confirmed

### 2. Exploration & Insight
- Run lightweight discovery: customer interviews, data pulls, desk research,
  competitor scans.
- Translate findings into opportunity areas and hypotheses worth testing.
- Decide which assumptions must be validated before committing to a solution.

**Checklist**
- [ ] Opportunity map or hypothesis list published
- [ ] Key assumptions tagged with confidence levels
- [ ] Insight summary shared with stakeholders
- [ ] Open questions, risks, and dependencies logged

### 3. Solution Definition
- Co-create the recommended experience with experience flows, prototypes, and
  narrative storytelling.
- Outline the technical approach, sequencing, and resource needs.
- Finalise the success metrics, analytics plan, and launch narrative.

**Checklist**
- [ ] Proposed solution articulated visually and verbally
- [ ] Technical plan with slices, integrations, and safeguards agreed
- [ ] Content, messaging, and positioning notes ready for go-to-market partners
- [ ] Measurement plan (instrumentation, dashboards, review cadence) documented
- [ ] Decision log updated with approvals and outstanding questions

### 4. Delivery & Launch
- Drive execution using the lightest structure that keeps contributors aligned.
- Confirm QA, security, enablement, and support steps are owned and progressing.
- Prepare launch communications, training, and support documentation.

**Checklist**
- [ ] Implementation tasks assigned with clear owners and status
- [ ] QA, testing, and monitoring plans reviewed and executed
- [ ] Launch assets (announcements, enablement, FAQs) finalised
- [ ] Support and operations teams briefed
- [ ] Launch go/no-go review complete with risk mitigations recorded

### 5. Measurement & Evolution
- Review performance against the agreed success measures and guardrails.
- Capture qualitative signal from customers, support, and internal teams.
- Recommend follow-up experiments, iterations, or sunsetting decisions.

**Checklist**
- [ ] Outcome report covering metrics, learnings, and recommendations shared
- [ ] Telemetry reviewed for stability, performance, and anomalies
- [ ] Improvement backlog updated with owners and due dates
- [ ] Next review or iteration window scheduled

## Communication Cadence

- **Async status update (2–3x per week):** progress, blockers, upcoming decisions.
- **Decision review (as needed):** focused session to resolve open questions or
  approve scope changes.
- **Launch readiness review:** structured walk-through of readiness checklists and
  risk mitigations.
- **Measurement readout:** short narrative summarising outcomes and next steps.

## Artefacts & Templates

- **Engagement brief:** single page with problem, audience, outcomes, and key
  constraints.
- **Opportunity tracker:** lightweight table of hypotheses, evidence, status, and
  owner.
- **Design kit:** Figma file, prototypes, content doc, and annotated walkthrough.
- **Technical plan:** architecture sketch, integration notes, and implementation
  slices.
- **Outcome report:** snapshot of metrics, qualitative signal, and recommended
  actions.

## Tooling Principles

- Default to collaborative, async-friendly tools (Notion, Linear, FigJam, Loom)
  and link artefacts instead of duplicating them.
- Automate reporting wherever possible with dashboards or scheduled digests.
- Archive final assets and decision logs in a shared workspace so future
  engagements start with context.

## Continuous Improvement

After every engagement or major milestone, the operations-partner runs a short
retro. Document what to keep, what to change, and who owns improvements. Update
this handbook when new practices outperform the current ones.

Stay lean, stay clear, and keep the focus on delivering measurable value for
clients.
